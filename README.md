# Global Liquid Mob

## The current thinking goes something like this:
**Hypothesis:** Ensemble/Mob programming, as a format, is very resilient and thrives on collaboration, _so resilient_ that a mob can continually form and _reform_ throughout the course of a single day, and even _continue_ for as long the people involved choose to do so.

**Conclusion to be tested:** It is possible to construct a globe-spanning mob that maintains the _fluid_ nature of single-piece work throughout multiple continuous 24 hour cycles by changing the makeup of the mob throughout each day in a structured way, generally “flowing” east-to-west in a non-stop and sustainable fashion.

A simplistic example of what is proposed has groups of between 2 an 3 people all participating from within 1 or more neighboring time zone(s) identified as a single “group”. They are separated by approximately 3-5 hours on either side from two similar groups: one to the east, another to the west. Each group, in their local morning, combine to mob with the group to their east making what they view as a _morning_ mob. The two groups function as one mob totaling 4-6 people.

In this model, each group takes a break at the midpoint of their day, after which they reform into an _afternoon_ mob, having left the group to their _east_ and now _joining_ with the group to their _west_, again separated from them by approximately 3-5 time zones.

In general, at all times, there is a functioning mob of roughly 4-6 people who have carried the code base further with each successive change. This will initially feel strange, because it is very new. In the format’s _full_ implementation the same cycles repeat each day, then it is expected that these cycles will become routine.

**Open questions**
There are many questions about the details: That is what the experiment is designed to surface. There are also some absolutes:
* at any given time a _“mob"_ consists of _at least_ four people, and not more than 7 (with the exception of a mob behaving like normal people and breaking for a meal),
* actively working together on the _same thing_, 
* on _one computer at a time_, as the driver rotates.

Some of the advantages of a global and fluid model include but are not limited to:
* _where_ people _are_ can vary widely _so long as_ they can work _together_.
* at each change of who is part of a given mob, there are _multiple_ other mobbers 
that have been working on that solution for roughly _the last four hours_, so there is effectively no "break" or "handoff". 
It is more akin to a continuous _flow_.
* Learning is going on continuously, and it may turn out that the role of ["archivist"](https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg/blob/master/theArchivist.pdf) is elevated in this model to reinforce continguous learning and communication at multiple levels.


Some minimally viable conditions can be met for almost all participants, _ideally_ continuously: 
1. a reliable computer connection, 
2. _minimally_, good voice connectivity, 
3. ideally, video connection that allows each participant to see all other participants, 
4. the ability to transfer control of the code being worked on between individuals easily, or, control of a single computer that is editing the code.
Note that none of the above challenges are significantly different from remote pair programming. They are challenges with well-known solutions or remediations. Not every participant may be able to meet all of the above conditions all of time (technology sometimes fails us and this isn't any different than in a normal workday).

## The current focus

What we are modeling is a _slice_ of a workweek: 2 consecutive days, functioning as a mob (many different connected mobs actually), developing a project[^2], together.

**Q1 — What constitutes a Mob/Ensemble?**
At any given time a “mob" consists of at least four people, and not more than 7,
actively working together on the same thing,
on one computer at a time, as the driver rotates. The obvious exception is when people are breaking for a meal.

**Q2 — Do I have to join for the entire day?** " is often asked, as well as "**When do I join this thing?**" 
**_When_** you participate **and for how long _is entirely up to you_**. You can join from wherever you are on the planet, and the event should be in full swing the _**entire calendar day Saturday**_, and _**most of Sunday**_.

See the images above to see where people are most likely to be joining from as the event travels around the globe.
It will be important  to carry an objective, a singular objective for any given mob/ensemble forward, like we do with REAL coding projects. 

**Q3 —  Is there a Slack Group?**
**Yes** - [Software Crafters Slack Group](https://slack.softwarecrafters.org/) has a "#liquid-mob-session-log" channel. Please copy and paste captures from the micro-retros in that channel. If you can, please post links after the event to any social media entries (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc) about your experience at the event.

## UPDATE:
In June the basic model was validated for the first time. See these experinece reports where people from all over the world worked on the same codebase a totsl of 27 hours, continuoesly:
